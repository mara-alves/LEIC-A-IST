# TC Project 2020-21
Project for the course *Teoria da Computação* made with Margarida Rodrigues.

The project consisted on writing four Turing Machines, each in it's own file: *complem.txt*, *compor.txt*, *while.txt* and *ifthenelse.txt*. These files follow the appropriate format to run on [this simulator](https://github.com/kiriloman/Multitape-Non-Deterministic-Turing-Machine).
Check out "Enunciado.pdf" for more information.

Final grade: `3.5/4`.
