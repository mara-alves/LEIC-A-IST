# IPM Project 3 2020-21
This project consists on reducing the time users take to write on a smartwatch interface. 

For simplicity, we used the online p5 editor. To quickly access and run our final interface go to [this link](https://editor.p5js.org/ist194179/sketches/f_gEkyTMC).
Video required for the delivery available [here](https://youtu.be/99InCh1WEVI).

Final grade was `18.0/20.0`.
