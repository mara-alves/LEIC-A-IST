# IPM Projects 2021-22
Projects (or "Bake-offs") for the course *Interfaces Pessoa Máquina*, made with my colleagues Luís Freire D'Andrade and Margarida Rodrigues. 

## Project 1
Bake-off 1 is not included since it didn't involve any coding. However, in case you're curious, it consisted on making a mid-fidelity prototype for a water and power consumptions app. Our final prototype made in figma is available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/dtmcIXeyuV3qrkE11e5taR/PMF?node-id=0%3A1) and the creation process is described in [this video](https://youtu.be/_YsfmAkNqf8). Our grade was `17.8/20.0`, with the only penalties coming from the video.
