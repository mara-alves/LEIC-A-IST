# IPM Project 2 2020-21
This project consists on reducing the time users take to select targets in an abstract interface. 

For simplicity, we used the online p5 editor. To quickly access and run our final interface go to [this link](https://editor.p5js.org/maraalves2001/sketches/FQOafTpJg).
Video required for the delivery available [here](https://youtu.be/CSH_waH2zIw).

Our group had the best average time from our class. 
Final grade was `19.0/20.0`. The only penalties were from the video.
