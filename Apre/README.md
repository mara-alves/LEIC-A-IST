# Apre Projects 2021-22
Projects (also known as "Homeworks") for the course *Aprendizagem*, made with my colleague Margarida Rodrigues. While these aren't coding projects per se, I decided to include them here since all of these have at least one exercise solved in Python with scikit-learn.

Check out: "Enunciado.pdf" for the questions; "G057.pdf" for our answers; the .py files for our code; "SolutionNotes.pdf" for the teacher's resolution and grading notes; and "Pauta.pdf" for our score in each individual question (lines for group 57).

Our grades:
- First project: `18.2/20.0`
- Second project: `17.0/20.0`
- Third project:  `18.05/20.00`
- Fourth project:  `16.1/20.0`
