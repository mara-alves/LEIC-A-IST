# IAC Project 2 2019-20
Second part of the project for the course *Introdução à Arquitetura de Computadores*.

On this final part, we represented the movement of the object (in this case a ball, character 'o') in the terminal using the functions developed in the first part. However, instead of using only the acceleration from gravity, we were required to use the acceleration from the accelerometer of the board used.

For more in-depth information, check the *Enunciado.pdf*, which contains the information the teachers gave us.
