# IAC Project 1 2019-20
First part of the project for the course *Introdução à Arquitetura de Computadores*.

On this first part, we were required to implement functions to calculate the acceleration, velocity and position of an object on an inclined plane without friction, as well as a test cycle, both in Python and Assembly P4.

For more in-depth information, check the *Enunciado.pdf*, which contains the information the teachers gave us.
