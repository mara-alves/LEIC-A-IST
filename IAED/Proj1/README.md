# IAED Project 1 2019-20
First project for the course *Introdução aos Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados*. The objective was to develop in C a logistics system. For more details on the requirements check the [Enunciado.md](./Enunciado.md).

My grade on this project was `19.75/20.00`.

## How to Compile
- `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -ansi -pedantic -o proj1 *.c`

## How to Run
- `./proj1 < test.in > test.myout`

The folder *testes* contains several files that might be used as `test.in` to test the program.
