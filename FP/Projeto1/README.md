# FP Project 1 2020-21
First project for the first programming course I ever had, *Fundamentos da Programação*. 

It consists on 2d maze with obstacles, and several units that can move around the maze.

My final grade was `18.8/20.0`. The teacher's comments are available in the "95625.txt" file, and my score on each category in "Pauta.pdf".

## How to run
Type `python -i Projeto1.py` in the terminal.
